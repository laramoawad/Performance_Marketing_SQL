# I used SQL to help me analyze data exported from our dashboards on looker studio to help me in my every day job in performance marketing. I  use it to anlyze the quality of my audiences to help me make a more informed decision while optimizing my meta accounts. SQL helped me decide which audiences to use to increase overall lead count and quality based on the numbers. 

# I also use it to clean customer lists exported from our crm to create audiences on Meta, Snpachat, and Google that follow the guidelines needed on each platform.
