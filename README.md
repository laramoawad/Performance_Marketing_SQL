# I used SQL to help me analyze data in my every day job in performance marketing. I used it to fix customer lists used to create audiences on Meta, Snpachat, and Google that follow the guidelines needed on each platform. 

# I also used it to anlyze the quality of my audiences to help me make a more informed decision while optimizing my meta accounts, in which SQL helped me decide which audiences to use to increase overall lead count and quality based on the numbers.
